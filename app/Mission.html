  The mission of the Modern Technology (MT) Council is to bring Modern Technology to the forefront of local education, workforce, and business. We will increase public awareness and promote the same Open Standards (openness), philosophies, and culture that have revolutionized technology in the past decade. We will promote collaboration and best practices. We will lead the way in modern technology education. We will connect students to modern technologists and experienced engineers so they may contribute to projects supplied by the community and Council members. The result will be the production of top technologists from Massachusetts who remain in Massachusetts. Local businesses, organizations, and government will prosper from increased efficiency, greater visibility, and reduced costs resulting in a flourishing culture and economy.
